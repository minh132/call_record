# Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers
Gunicorn supports working as a process manager and allowing users to tell it which specific worker process class to use. Then Gunicorn would start one or more worker processes using that class.
I use [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) to test success rate when send many request with resource limit in docker-compose(2 core cpu and 2048m memory) . Result when use uvicorn and gunicorn with same config in JMeter, send 2500 request in 2 seconds and set timeout 2s:

Gunicorn

The result shows that using Gunicorn help error rate reduce from 84% to 39%
